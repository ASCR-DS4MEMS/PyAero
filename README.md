# PyAero Qt for Python version (PySide2)

PyAero version based on the **Qt for Python (alias PySide2)** GUI API

**Reasoning for going with Qt for Python**

PyAero started based on the PyQt4 which for me was the API to go at the time when I started development. PyAero two years ago achieved an 80% state (nevertheless I gave version 1.1.0, proudnessness)

After a small creative break (two years) I decided to upgrad to PyQt5 and continue development. I soon realized that the PyQt5 documentation lacks information, i.e. there were only links to the Qt C++ documentation and no Python related docs, I had the feelig that the PyQt5 development probably stagnates.

Short online research revealed to me that meanwhile Qt themselves are developing now **Qt for Python (alias PySide2)** which is based on the legacy Pyside API. This made me think that it is possibly best to go with Qt for Python as it is tightly coupled to Qt.
