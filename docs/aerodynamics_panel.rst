Aerodynamics (panel code)
=========================

For fast lift coefficient calculations a panel method has been implemented. The code is based on an open source code developed by the `Barba group <https://lorenabarba.com/>`_. The codes in `Aeropython <https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython>`_ are part of a series of lessons of a university course. The specific module used here is based on a vortex-source panel method (code in `module 4 <https://nbviewer.org/github/barbagroup/AeroPython/blob/master/lessons/11_Lesson11_vortexSourcePanelMethod.ipynb>`_).
