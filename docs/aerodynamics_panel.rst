Aerodynamics (panel code)
=========================

For fast lift coefficient calculations a panel method has been implemented. The code used here is based on an open source code developed by the `Barba group <https://lorenabarba.com/>`_. The code is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython>`_ and is based on a vortex-source panel method (code in module 4 https://nbviewer.org/github/barbagroup/AeroPython/blob/master/lessons/11_Lesson11_vortexSourcePanelMethod.ipynb).
